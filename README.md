This a course project in SDM5002. It called **Asculus** and we team built a system to use VR to control robot arm.

This repository contains:

1. The background of our projects and motivation.
2. Hardware and the configuration of our projects 
3. The tutorial to use our project
4. The code we used 
5. Our individual code/ CAD model / personal report

## Background

In SDM5002, we were required to explore our interested project without any limit. After a series technology survey and competitive product survey,  we **focused our application on the emergency**
**rescue of cardiac arrest patients.** In our imagination, medical professionals can use VR to control AEDs for first aids.
